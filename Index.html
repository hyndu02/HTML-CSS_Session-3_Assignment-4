                        <p>Fruits contain at least 90 to 95 percent water which is also an important nutrient. Basically fruit benefits a healthy lifestyle by giving us carbohydrates, fiber and micro-nutrients which aids our bodies to function properly. Fruits give you more energy than sugar or sweets as they contain natural glucose and fructose.
                        They also contain minerals, vitamins and nutrients that are useful for a healthy life. You can make amazing, mouth-watering and delectable sweets, desserts and juices with fresh fruits. They are easy to cook and digest easily. Some of the popular and healthy fruits that can be consumed in your everyday meal are apples, banana, grapefruit, mango, orange, strawberry, guava, papaya, watermelon, muskmelon, sweet lime etc.</p>
